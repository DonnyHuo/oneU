        These Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) explains the terms and
        conditions by which you may access and use <a className="_title underline cursor-pointer" href="https://www.1usdt.io">https://www.1usdt.io</a> and any
        subdomains associated with the Website. You must read this Agreement
        carefully as it governs your use of the Website. By accessing or using
        the Website, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be
        bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are
        not authorized to access or use the Website and should not use the
        Website.

        NOTICE: This Agreement contains important information, including a
        binding arbitration provision and a class action waiver, both of which
        impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved. The Website is only
        available to you — and you should only access the Website — if you agree
        completely with these terms.

      <div className="_title mt-10 mb-2 text-xl">Introduction</div>
      <div>
        To access the site, you must use non-custodial wallet software, which
        allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with
        that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by that third party’s
        applicable terms of service, not this Agreement. Wallets are not
        operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with us, and we have no
        custody or control of the contents of your wallet, nor can we retrieve
        or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to our website, you
        agree to be bound by this Agreement and all terms incorporated by
        reference into this Agreement.

        posted, and your continued accessing or use of the Website will serve as
        confirmation of your acceptance of those modifications. If you do not
        agree with any modifications to this Agreement, you must immediately
        stop accessing and using the Website.

        Non-Custodial and No Fiduciary Duties
      </div>
      <div>
        The Website is a purely non-custodial application, meaning we do not
        ever have custody, possession, or control of your digital assets at any
        time. It further means you are solely responsible for the custody of the
        cryptographic private keys to the digital asset wallets you hold and you
        should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone.
        We accept no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with
        your use of a wallet and make no representations or warranties regarding
        how the Website will operate with any specific wallet. Likewise, you are
        solely responsible for any associated wallet and we are not liable for
        any acts or omissions by you in connection with or as a result of your
        wallet being compromised. This Agreement is not intended to, and does
        not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent
        permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary
        duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent
        any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those
        duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and
        eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that
        we owe you are those set out expressly in this Agreement.

      <div>
        Obligations The Website may not be available or appropriate for use in
        your jurisdiction. By accessing or using the Website, you agree that you
        are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws and
        regulations that may apply to you. Specifically, your use of the Website
        or the Protocol may result in various tax consequences, such as income
        or capital gains tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, or sales
        tax in certain jurisdictions.It is your responsibility to determine
        whether taxes apply to any transactions you initiate or receive and, if
        so, to report and/or remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax
        authority.
      </div>
      <div className="_title mt-10 mb-2 text-xl">Assumption of Risk</div>
      <div>
        By accessing and using the Website, you represent that you are
        financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the
        inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based
        systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and
        intricacies of digital assets such as ether (ETH), so-called
        stablecoins, and other digital tokens. In particular, you understand
        that the markets for these digital assets are nascent and highly
        volatile due to risk factors including (but not limited to) adoption,
        speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You understand that
        anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens
        and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and
        accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens.
        So-called stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may
        not be fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics
        and runs. Further, you understand that smart contract transactions
        automatically execute and settle, and that blockchain-based transactions
        are irreversible when confirmed. You acknowledge and accept that the
        cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based
        systems such as Ethereum are variable and may increase dramatically at
        any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk of selecting to
        trade in Expert Modes, which can expose you to potentially significant
        price slippage and higher costs. If you act as a liquidity provider to
        the Protocol through the Website, you understand that your digital
        assets may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to
        the Protocol through the Website due to the fluctuation of prices of
        tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool. Finally, you understand that
        we do not create, own, or operate cross-chain bridges and we do not make
        any representation or warranty about the safety or soundness of any
        cross-chain bridge. In summary, you acknowledge that we are not
        responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not own or control
        the Protocol, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that
        you experience while accessing or using the Website. Accordingly, you
        understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks
        of accessing and using the Website to interact with the Protocol.
